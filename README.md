# ivs_sessions_browser

For a long time, I've been missing the ability to browse through sessions in the terminal, applying filters and opening sessions.

This is my crack at solving this issue, at least for myself. Remember this is still a work in progress, as I'd like to also include the intensives! 

Feel free to use/edit/comment.
